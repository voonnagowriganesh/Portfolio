              I have hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, Java, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken several significant projects, such as the Fantasy Cricket Team Builder and Crime Prediction and Analysis.
